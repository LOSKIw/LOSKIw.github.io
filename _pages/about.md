I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lai-Man Po](http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~lmpo/).

I received the B.Eng. degree in computer science from the North China Electric Power University in 2022, and the M.S. degree in multimedia information technology from the City University of Hong Kong in 2023.
