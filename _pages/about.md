I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Po Lai-Man](http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~lmpo/).

I received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and technology from the [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/), and the M.S. degree in multimedia information technology from the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/).

During my undergraduate studies, I joined the computer vision lab at school of control and computer engineering, under the supervision of [Prof. Shi Min](https://cce.ncepu.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/rjgcjys/11887a993a444b23b4af863190aed157.htm). I primarily focused on computer vision tasks, specifically saliency detection and image enhancement.

My research interests are deep learning and computer vision. Recently, I am working on image generating task.
